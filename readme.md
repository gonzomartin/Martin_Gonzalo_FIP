# Project Name
    * Gonzalo's Museum of Collections and Memories. *
        Final Integrated Project for the IDP career.
        I decide that the best way to deal with a final assigment is create something that you really enjoy to do, so thats why i creted a website with all my spcial memories and decide to give it a look a like as a museum, a pretty cool one ofcourse.


## Installation
    You can access to the repo and clone it on GitHub here >> 
    * https://github.com/gonzomartin/Martin_Gonzalo_FIP.git *
    You will also required to have slick inquiry that is already on the GitHub folder to be avaible to use the complete funcionality of the img gallery on the HomePage and the Page4

## Usage
    In this case this project is all setup to clone the repository on GitHub, everything is mainly created a HTML and CSS base, you will see as i said before that there is some JavaScript that was took from https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ for the purpose to have a more interactive gallery.

## Contributing
    Feel free to go on the code and make some awesome pull requests! But obviusly before you plase your magic hands on my project, just let me know the heck you gonna do, only pros here.

## History
    ### MainPage
        1. I start with the base HTML and the understanding of how to use the grids and displays to locate the navigation bar on the top, with the right information on the buttoms and then i move on to the hover efects with the little square that is used as a brand graphic.
        2. Locate the sections on the body to determine the distribution of the boxes following the visual reference made it before. 
        3. General clases where created to facilitate further work as two-items three-items or one-item.
        4. All the svg where set up as img to avoid inconcistens on the paths
        5. It was important to create a interactive gallery so here we add a JavaScrip functions that was took from https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ that allows the user to drag and move an in line gallery where are expose some of the Collections.
        6. Finishing with the page one is a section to know a little bit more about me, becouse as people said, the greates come at the last.
        7. A simple footer with a quick form where you can leave your mail to get contacted in case you want to contribute with some gifts.

    ### Collections
        1. In general from here the process start to been a little bit more easier since i used a lot of things that were setup on the MainPage, as the nav bar and the background photo (i only change the photo, code is the same).
        2. I set up the history navigation system that show you where are you on the general site, and it has a history of the prior pages to get where you are. Below this i setup the sort and filter buttons, but they dont work yet.
        3. I create a big grid and start organazing the Collections sections with the prior img organization that i had on the interactive gallery on MainPage, just that now is not an inline gallery, is a grid base one.
        4. I keep using the square at the end of a section to tell the user is the end, haha.
        5. Not JavaScript apply to this page.
    
    ### Stickers
        1. The develope of this sections was pretty similar to the Collection one, the box change a little bit since i dont have anything position absolute or relative, so i was avaible to setup a hover that help you to locate which stickers are you looking at on the gallery.
        2. Used the header, nav and filt/sort from last page as the same as the footer.
        3. Develope at the end of a button to go back to collections.

    ### Stickers-Don Fingo
        1. This was the final page to give it a complete look like to the galleries till you get directly in to one of the options. This sections uses the same nav, navigation history and filt/sort HTML as the last one, but we dont have a background in the top since the first this that we need to see is a photo been displayed in a sutil border box.
        2. Then we have the navigation of the displayed gallery where youre supose to been avaible to move and select and see the diferents photos that are on the sections. there is a hover to know exactly wich image are you seen, the other ones will appear in b/w and smaller.
        3. Below the displayed navigation we have the text information that is where you can find more info in to the artist and further meta data that helps to sort and filter all.
        4. We have a the botton another inline gallery made it with the same JavaScript used on the MainPage, on this one we going to have recomended stickers sections to been avaible to redirect to another collections.
